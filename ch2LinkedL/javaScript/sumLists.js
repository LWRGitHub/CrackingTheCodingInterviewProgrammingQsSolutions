/*

    Sum Lists: You have two numbers represented by a linked list, where each node contains a single
    digit. The digits are stored in reverse order, such that the 1's digit is at the head of the list. Write a
    function that adds the two numbers and returns the sum as a linked list. (You are not allowed to
    '"cheat" and just convert the linked list to an integer.)

    EXAMPLE
        Inout: (7-> 1 -> 6) + (5 -> 9 -> 2). That is, 617 + 295
        Outnut: 2 -> 1 -› 9. That is. 912

    FOLLOW UP
        Suppose the digits are stored in forward order. Repeat the above problem.

        EXAMPLE
            Input: (6 -> 1 -> 7) + (2 -> 9 -> 5). That is, 617 + 295.
            Output: 9 -› 1 -› 2. That is, 912.
